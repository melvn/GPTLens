The severity is extremely high (9) as this directly enables token supply manipulation. Profitability is also 9, as attackers can mint and sell tokens for profit. The correctness is 9 because the exploit is technically valid if SafeMath is not applied to the multiplication operation.",

Severity is low (2) as it relies on user error (not resetting to zero first). Profitability is moderate (4) only if exploited, but it is not a direct exploit vector.
