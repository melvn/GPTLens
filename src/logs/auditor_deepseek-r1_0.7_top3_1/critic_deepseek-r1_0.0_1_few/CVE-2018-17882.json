If 'fights' is immutable or non-malicious, the impact is limited to forced token burns or disruptions. If 'fights' can be set by the attacker (e.g., via compromised owner), severity increases. Profitability is moderate only if the attacker can extract value from 'fights'.",

An attacker can craft a large '_to.length' and '_value' such that the product overflows to a small value (e.g., 0).
