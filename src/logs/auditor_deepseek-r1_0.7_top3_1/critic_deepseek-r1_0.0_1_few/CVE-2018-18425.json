        "vulnerability": "Non-standard ERC20 allowance freeze",
        "criticism": "The reasoning is correct. The function enforces a non-standard ERC20 behavior by blocking non-zero allowance updates, requiring users to reset to zero first. This creates a front-running risk during allowance adjustments. However, the severity is moderate because it primarily affects compatibility with standard contracts rather than enabling direct theft. Profitability for attackers is low, as exploitation requires specific user actions (allowance changes) and only allows stealing up to the original allowance amount.",
        "correctness": 9,
        "severity": 6,
        "profitability": 3,
        "reason": "The approve function prevents updating an existing non-zero allowance to another non-zero value. This violates ERC20 standards and forces users to reset their allowance to zero first, creating a race condition vulnerable to front-running attacks. Contracts/DEXs expecting standard behavior will fail when users try to adjust allowances, breaking compatibility and potentially locking funds.",

Severity is extreme (9) as it enables total fund loss. However, profitability scores 0 under the assumption that scoring reflects external attacker profit potential - this is strictly owner abuse. From a system impact perspective, this is a 9/9 vulnerability, but following prior example conventions for privileged roles, external attackers cannot exploit it.",

        "reason": "The withdraw function allows the owner to drain all ETH from the contract at any time.

This completely breaks the token's supply guarantee, enabling hyperinflation. Severity is catastrophic (9) as it undermines the token's fundamental economics.
